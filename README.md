# Titanic ML Project

## Overview
Predicting survival of Titanic passengers using machine learning.  
The project uses Random Forest with feature engineering to improve prediction accuracy.

## Steps
1. Data exploration (Sex, Pclass, Age, etc.)
2. Handle missing values
3. Feature engineering: FamilySize, Title, IsAlone, Deck
4. Model training: Random Forest with tuned hyperparameters
5. Generate Kaggle submission

## Results
- Validation accuracy: ~82%
- Kaggle leaderboard score: 0.77511

## Files
- `titanic.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code and explanations
- `faiz_submission.csv`: Kaggle submission
- `train.csv`, `test.csv`, `gender_submission.csv`: original dataset files

## How to Run
1. Open `titanic.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
2. Run all cells to replicate analysis and generate submission
